# Hotel-management-system

Hotel Managment System is the project I decided to submit as a project in Data Structures, where the combination of some main data structures help us better understand their functionality in important systems.

Room : With this feature, hotel staff can see a list of all the rooms, like the room number, type, how many people it can accommodate, the price per night, and whether it's available or not. They can quickly find vacant rooms and book them for guests.

Booking: This feature allows hotel staff to book rooms for guests. They just need to enter the guest's name, email, phone number, check-in date, and check-out date. The system is smart enough to make sure there are no conflicting bookings.

Guests: This feature keeps all the guest info in one place. Hotel staff can easily access guest details like their name, contact info, and booking history. It's like having a personal assistant for guest management!

Staff: Hotel staff can add and remove employees from the system. They can update employee info, like names, positions, and contact details. It's a great way to keep the hotel team roster up to date.

Reporting: This feature is super handy for monitoring the hotel's performance. Hotel staff can generate reports on room occupancy, guest bookings, and employee info. It helps them make smart decisions based on the data.
